<h1>Judging the Efficiency of Estimators using Monte Carlo Simulations</h1>
<h2> What is a Monte Carlo Simulation ?</h2>
<p> The Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that predicts possible outcomes of an uncertain event.
  It is used to analyze past data to predict a range of future outcomes.

<h2>Monte Carlo Simulation within the Scope of the Project</h2>
  The Monte Carlo simulation is of particularly great use in problems concerning inputs that are stochatic in nature. 
  Such inputs include the random variables of a random process such as a Gaussian random process. For this project a Monte Carlo simulation was used to.
